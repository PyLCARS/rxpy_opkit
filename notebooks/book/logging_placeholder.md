This section demonstrates all the logging operators available in RxPy OpKit. These operators help you debug, monitor, and understand the behavior of your reactive streams using Loguru for structured logging.

The full notebook with interactive examples can be found in the `notebooks/logging` directory.

## Main Features

- **Basic Stream Logging**: Log values as they pass through streams
- **Rich Formatted Logging**: Display complex data structures with proper formatting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track throughput and timing statistics
- **Conditional Logging**: Log only values that meet specific criteria
- **Error Handling with Logging**: Robust error tracking in reactive streams
