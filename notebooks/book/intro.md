# RxPy OpKit

A toolkit for reactive programming with RxPy, providing operators and implementation tools.

## Overview

RxPy OpKit is a collection of utilities and operators that extend the capabilities of the RxPy (Reactive Extensions for Python) library. It provides:

- Custom operators for common operations
- Logging operators for debugging reactive streams
- Implementation tools for reactive programming patterns
- Examples and patterns for declarative reactive programming

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **Operators**: Custom operators extending RxPy's capabilities
- **Logging**: Specialized operators for logging and debugging
- **Tools**: Implementation utilities for reactive programming

## Getting Started

See the [Installation](getting_started/installation.md) guide to get started with RxPy OpKit.
